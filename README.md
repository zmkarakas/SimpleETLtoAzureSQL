# SimpleETLtoAzureSQL

This repo is for my personal use, with ETL scripts that I occasionally borrow from. (sink is Azure)

More ideas for ETL scripts:

Handling multiple data sources: Instead of reading data from a single CSV file, can utilize multiple sources such as CSV, Excel, JSON, or databases, and combine them into a single data structure for processing.

Parallel processing: If the data size is large and processing time is long, divide the data into smaller chunks and process each chunk in parallel using the multiprocessing library in Python, or use pyspark with clusters.

Error handling and retries: Add error handling and retries to ensure that the ETL process does not fail due to temporary network or database issues. Use try and except blocks to catch exceptions and retry the failed operation.

Data validation and quality checks: Implement additional data validation and quality checks to ensure that the data meets the requirements before being loaded into the database. Write custom functions to check for missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.

Custom logging: Instead of using the basic logging, customize the logging to capture additional information such as the number of rows processed, the time taken for processing, and the status of each step. (Very useful for troubleshooting)

Automated testing: Write automated tests to validate the correctness of the ETL process and ensure that it behaves as expected (check the result).
